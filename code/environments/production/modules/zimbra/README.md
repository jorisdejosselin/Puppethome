Puppet Module to manage the Zimbra Mail Server
==============================================
##Description

A Puppet module to manage the Zimbra Collaboration Suite.
As of this moment, the module is able to manage users and mailing lists.
To improve performance,  when prefetching the state of resources, the provider uses ldapsearch 
however,  when  making configuration changes, the zmprov utility is used to ensure date consistency-- 
at the expense of performance.


##Sample usage

puppet resource zimbra_user domain=mydomain.com

    zimbra_user {
        'rocky':
            ensure       => present,
            domain       => 'mydomain.com',
            aliases      => ['mordor@mydomain.com', 'marciano@mydomain.com'],
            user_name    =>  'Rocky Marciano',
            mailbox_size => '1G';
     }

    zimbra_list {
        'list':
            ensure => present,
            aliases => ['floyd@mydomain.com','pink@mydomain.com'],
            members => ['rocky@mydomain.com','saruman@mydomain.com'],
            domain => 'mydomain.com',
    }
